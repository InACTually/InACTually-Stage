# ‚úíÔ∏è Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! üéâ \
Whether you are fixing a bug, suggesting an improvement, or just asking a question, you are helping make this better. \
Let‚Äôs make something great together. üöÄ

We will extend this contributing guideline if needed.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Public Attribution

Please note: Contributions are public and attributed to your GitHub account. If you'd prefer to stay anonymous, feel free to reach out or submit under a pseudonymous fork. Otherwise your (GitHub) name will be listed as contributor and/or in the credits ;) \
As a community we use a centralized copyright `Copyright (c) <year> InACTually Community` in the files. We will have a list of authors/contributors.


<br>

## ü™≤ Got an Idea or Found a Bug?

- Use [Issues](https://github.com/InACTually/InACTually-Stage/issues) to share bugs, ideas, or feedback.
- Be clear and include relevant context, logs, or screenshots when possible.

## üì¨ How to Contribute

At first, best is always to contact us, but in the end it boils down to:

1. **Fork** this repo and create your branch off of `main` or better from a special `develop`. Branch name is best like `dev-feature_MyFeature` 
2. **Code cleanly** and write clear commit messages (see below). 
3. **Open a pull request** with a short description of what you did.

As a community we use centralized copyright `Copyright (c) <year> InACTually Community`.
So, if you have significantly contributed to a file, please add your name (as you like) to the "contributors"-list of that file.
If you have created a new file, please add our standard notice at the beginning of the file (as you can find in all others) and start the "contributors"-list with your name. \
Do not forget to change the "modified"-year of that file :)

To contribute, make sure your commits include a Signed-off-by line like `Signed-off-by: Name <email>`. You can add this automatically with:

    `git commit -s`

By doing so, you certify the following:
